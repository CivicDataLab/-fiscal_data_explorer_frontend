How to contribute ?
-------
 * Create an issue for a feature/bug.
 * Discuss the implementation on the issue itself while attaching the supporting docs there.
 * Create a new branch for the issue.
 * Code in the branch.
 * Open a PR with the very first commit and add a WIP prefix to the title of the PR. e.g. WIP: Fix #1 - Fixed bar chart labels.
 * When finished with the implementation, request reviews and remove the WIP prefix.
 * If approved, merge the branch. If you are merging from your local CLI(instead of Github UI), make sure your merge commit message contain Fix #1 (for our          example, the issue number is 1, replace it with whatever issue number you worked on).
 * Go back and check if your issue is closed or not, if not just close it with a reference to the PR which closes it and then go ahead and delete the                branch.
