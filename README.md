**How to get setup local server and run this react app**

1. Make sure you have nodejs installed on your system: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Then install yarn. Yarn is a package manager. https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable
3. Now clone this repo folder to your machine. Branch out from it.
4. Then open up your preferred terminal application and change directory to enter this folder on your machine.
5. then run the command ``` yarn ```. What this will do is download all your package dependencies (node_modules) based on those mentioned in the package.json file.
6. Once these node_modules are downloaded, run ``` yarn start ```. This will fire up a local server on ```localhost:3000``` and you are good to go!
